# Banking Data Analysis Dashboard

An end-to-end data analytics pipeline that extracts banking data from a SQL database, processes it using Python, and visualizes insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The project demonstrates my ability to work across the full data lifecycle—from raw data extraction to meaningful business insights.



## Project Overview

This project analyzes banking customer data to uncover insights related to customer behavior, transaction trends, and loan performance. It showcases the integration of SQL, Python, and Power BI in a real-world business intelligence workflow.



##  Tools & Technologies

- **SQL Server** – Data extraction and querying
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling and dashboard development
- **Power Query** – Data transformation within Power BI
- **DAX** – Calculated columns and measures



##  Dashboard Features

- **Customer Segmentation** – Visualized by age group, gender, and income
- **Loan Analysis** – Approval rates, default trends, and loan types
- **Transaction Insights** – Monthly and category-wise spending behavior


##  Data Processing Steps

1. **SQL Extraction:** Queried raw banking data from the database.
2. **Python Cleaning:** Removed nulls, standardized formats, and engineered new features.
3. **Power BI Modeling:** Established data relationships, created calculated columns/measures.
4. **Dashboard Design:** Built clean, interactive reports with slicers and visual cues.
